His approach to development and QA, alongside his pragmatic view of reusability, stand above people with significantly more experience.

I was sorry to see him move on from that project and the opening he left was difficult to fill. I would recommend Miro wholeheartedly and hope to work with him again in the future."

His ability to merge high-level technical skills with real-world applications has been instrumental in driving our project forward. Miro's insights have been invaluable, contributing significantly to both my work and the project as a whole. Though his departure leaves big shoes to fill, his future team is incredibly lucky to have him. Wishing Miro all the best in his new endeavors – his impact here will be remembered."
