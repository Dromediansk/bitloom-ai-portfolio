# Marketing Specialist Agent — Website Audit for Bitloom

## 1. Hero Section & First Impressions

**The value proposition is generic.** "Digital Solutions from Bold Ideas" could describe any of 50,000+ dev shops. Your real differentiator — healthcare and fintech experience where reliability is non-negotiable — is buried in the About page.

- **Suggested tagline**: _"Reliable Software for Industries Where Failure Isn't an Option"_
- **Suggested description**: _"We build web and mobile applications for healthcare and fintech companies — industries where security, compliance, and reliability are non-negotiable."_
- **CTA hierarchy is backwards** — "Let's Talk" should be primary (conversion action), not "Explore Services" (informational). Better yet: _"Book a Free Consultation"_
- **No proof in the hero** — Add "Trusted by engineering leaders at Aptitude Global and Cognitive Creators" with logos below CTAs

| Issue                       | Impact | Effort |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Rewrite tagline/description | HIGH   | LOW    |
| Swap CTA hierarchy          | HIGH   | LOW    |
| Add social proof to hero    | HIGH   | LOW    |

---

## 2. Social Proof & Trust Signals

- **Testimonials are strong but buried** on a separate References page — extract pull quotes and place them on the homepage/services
- **No client logos anywhere** — add a "Trusted by" logo strip (Aptitude Global, Cognitive Creators)
- **No third-party validation** — create profiles on Clutch.co and Google Business for independent credibility

---

## 3. Content & Copywriting

- **Copy is feature-centric, not outcome-centric** — "We craft exceptional web experiences" should become "Your customers will experience faster load times and interfaces that convert"
- **No pain points addressed** — Add language like "Tired of developers who miss deadlines?" or "Need a partner who understands compliance requirements?"
- **"We" language dominates** — flip to "You/Your" language throughout
- **CTAs are repetitive** — "Ready to Start Your Project?" appears 3+ times verbatim. Make each CTA contextual to its section

---

## 4. Conversion Optimization

- **Homepage only shows Hero + Services** — this is the biggest structural issue. Most visitors never navigate beyond the landing page. Add project highlights, a testimonial strip, and a contact CTA to the homepage
- **Contact form lacks qualification fields** — add Budget Range dropdown and Project Type selector
- **No persistent CTA in navigation** — add a "Free Consultation" button to the nav bar
- **No "what happens next" information** — after form submission, explain the next steps (review → questionnaire → discovery call)

---

## 5. Competitive Positioning

**The site tries to be everything and differentiates from nothing.** Your actual competitive advantage (healthcare/fintech domain expertise from 6+ years) should lead the entire narrative.

- Position as _"the development partner for healthcare and fintech companies"_
- Mention compliance, data security, HIPAA, financial regulations in services
- "Product-oriented" is insider jargon that means nothing to buyers — replace with tangible benefit language

## 6. Major Missing Elements

| Missing Element                                                   | Impact | Effort |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| **Case studies** from real client work (even anonymized)          | HIGH   | HIGH   |
| **Pricing transparency** (ranges or "starting from")              | HIGH   | LOW    |
| **FAQ section** (process, timeline, pricing, post-launch support) | MEDIUM | LOW    |
| **Schema.org structured data** (LocalBusiness, Service, Review)   | MEDIUM | MEDIUM |
| **Localized sitemap** (missing /en/ and /sk/ variants)            | HIGH   | LOW    |
| **Lead magnet** (downloadable guide for email capture)            | MEDIUM | HIGH   |
| **Founder video** (60-90s introduction)                           | MEDIUM | MEDIUM |

---

## 7. Psychological Triggers

- **Reciprocity** — completely absent. Offer a _"Free 30-minute consultation"_ as the primary CTA
- **Scarcity** — genuine and unused. Add _"Currently accepting projects for Q2 2026"_ or _"2 project slots open for March"_ — this is real capacity limitation, not manufactured
- **Authority** — exists but poorly positioned. Surface it on the homepage, not just the About page
- **Loss aversion** — not used. Add framing like _"In healthcare software, the cost of a security breach isn't just financial — it's reputational"_

## The Strategic Takeaway

The single most impactful shift is **niching down to healthcare and fintech**. Miroslav already has the experience, the testimonials prove it, and the projects reference it. The website just needs to tell that story starting from the first pixel — not bury it four pages deep.
