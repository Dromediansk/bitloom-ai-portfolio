## i18n Implementation Guidelines

### Translation Structure

- Use descriptive keys that reflect content purpose, not just location

### Component Implementation

- Use `"use client"` directive for components using `useTranslations()`
- Import: `import { useTranslations } from "next-intl"`
- Usage: `const t = useTranslations("sectionName"); t("keyName")`
- Nest translation keys logically by component/section

### Adding New Content

- Add translations to both `en.json` and `sk.json` files
- Maintain consistent key structure across both languages
- Use professional, business-appropriate tone for both languages
- Slovak translations should sound natural, not machine-translated

## Optional Enhancements

- **Dark Mode** with Tailwind theming
- **Framer Motion** for transitions
- **Sitemap.xml** and **robots.txt** for SEO completeness
- **RSS feed** if a blog is added later
